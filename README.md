# 📈 Website Traffic Analysis and Dashboard

This project analyzes website traffic data to uncover how different traffic sources, session behaviors, and repeat visits influence conversion rates.  
It combines Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for EDA and a Power BI dashboard for interactive business insights.
